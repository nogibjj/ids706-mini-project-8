# Python & Rust Performance Comparison

![CI](https://github.com/nogibjj/ids706-mini-project-8/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg) 

This project compares the performance of Python and Rust for calculating mean, median, and standard deviation for each column of a dataset.

## Results

- For calculating mean, median, and std of each column in **Python**, it took **0.008 seconds**. <br>
